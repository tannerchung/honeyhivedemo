Mixed content occurs when secure and non-secure content is mixed.\n\n2. **Verify File Size**: Make sure the file you are trying to upload is under 100MB. If it exceeds this limit, consider using chunked uploads.\n\n3. **Clear Cache**: After making any changes, clear your browser cache or CDN cache to avoid stale content that might be causing the issue.\n\n4. **Retry the Upload**: Once you have confirmed the URL is correct and the file size is appropriate, try the upload again.\n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please let me know!",
