Verify that there are no trailing slashes or incorrect paths.\n\n2. **File Size Verification**: Make sure the file you are trying to upload is under 100MB. If it exceeds this limit, consider using chunked uploads.\n\n3. **Clear Cache**: After making any changes, clear your browser cache or CDN cache to avoid stale content that might cause 404 errors.\n\n4. **Retry the Upload**: Once you have confirmed the URL is correct and the file size is appropriate, attempt the upload again. \n\nIf you continue to experience issues, please let me know!",
